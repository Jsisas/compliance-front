# Alfred front-end
This project was made regarding ajujaht startup "Alfred". 

## Description
Alfred is a tool to manage the company's data protection program. Information security processes are complex and time-consuming, and audits are a headache for professionals whose relationship with everyday work is difficult to grasp. Verification of compliance remains the responsibility of the individual, although it is the responsibility of each employee to ensure safety. Alfred is a tool that combines regulatory requirements with security measures, risks, and data assets, and helps you plan your day-to-day operations so that the information you need for an audit is created as a by-product of your work. With Alfred, you know exactly what's done, what's not done, and who should do what next. Alfred is backed by a 7-member team with years of experience in data protection, B2B software development, and product design.

# Setup
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
